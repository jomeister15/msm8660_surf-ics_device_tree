Hello, and welcome to my CAF-ICS device tree for the skyrocket. The following steps should be used if you wish
to compile CAF-ICS from source.

1) Initialize a build enviornment.

I followed the instructions linked here -----> http://source.android.com/source/initializing.html Note: For Ubnutu users trying to compile that do not have java installed on their computer, I would recommend intstalling java by using this link -------> http://www.bogdanovic.se/installing-oracle-sun-jdk-6-on-ubuntu as this is the only method that worked for me.



2) Download the source.

To download the CAF-ICS source, simply enter the following commands into terminal.

  A) mkdir ~/CAF-ICS

  B) cd ~/CAF-ICS

  C) repo init -u git://codeaurora.org/platform/manifest.git -b ics -m M8260AAABQNLZA30120.xml --repo-url=git://codeaurora.org/tools/repo.git

  D) repo sync -j8 (use a lower -jx number if your connection is slow)

  E) Go get a sandwich. Seriously, this will take awhile to check out.



3) Set up the device tree using these commands.

  A) rm -rf device/qcom/msm8660_surf

  B) git clone git://github.com/jomeister15/msm8660_surf-ics_device_tree device/qcom/msm8660_surf


4) Start the build using these commands.

  A) source build/envsetup.sh

  B) choosecombo 1 2 msm8660_surf eng

  C) make -j4 KERNEL_DEFCONFIG=msm8660_defconfig



I will add more instructions as to how to build with QC_PROP=true, etc as soon as I can make more necessary changes to the device tree.
